# Book Swap App - MVP BUILD

This is a book swapping app developed using React Native and Supabase. Users can list their books and trade them with other users to obtain different books, helping reduce the need to buy new, and connecting readers with other like-minded people.

The project is still in development and currently only works when previewed within a web browser.

## Features

- User authentication: Users can sign up and log in to the app.
- List books: Users can list their old books that they don't want.
- Trade books: Users can request other users' books and initiate a swap.
- Wishlist: Users can add a book to their wishlist, updating the most popular books in the database.
- Real-time notifications, alerting user to new swap requests
- Real-time chat, where users can chat with other users when a swap request has been confirmed, to discuss postage and delivery.
